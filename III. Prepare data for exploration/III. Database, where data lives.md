# I. Working with databases

- Metadata: data about data 
- Relational database: a database that contains a series of related tables that can be connected via thier relationship 
- Primary key: an identifier that references a column in which each value is unique 
  + Ensure data in a specific column is unique 
  + Uniquely identifies a record in a relational database table 
  + Only one primary key ia allowed in a table 
  + Cannot contain null or blank values 
  
- Foreign key: a field within a table that's a primary key in another table 
  + More than one foreign key is allowed to exist in a table 
  + A column or group of columns in a relational database table that provides a link between the data and two tables 
  + Refers to the field in a table that's the primary key of another table
  
# II. Managing data with metadata

- Types of metadata: 
  + Descriptive: metadata that describes a piece of data and can be used to identify it at a later point in time 
  + Structural: metadata that indicates how a piece of data is organized and whether it's part of one or more than one data collection 
  + Administrative: metadata that indicates the technical source of a digital asset 

- Metadata repository: a database specifically created to store metadata 
  + Describe the state and location of the metadata 
  + Describe the structures of the table inside 
  + Describe how the data flows through the repository 
  + Keep track of who accesses the metadata and when

- Benefits of metadata: 
  + Metadata creates a single cource of truth by keeping things consistent and uniform 
  + Metadata makes data more reliable by keeping it consistent, reliable, precise 
  
# III. Accessing different data sources
# VI. Sorting and filtering
- Sorting involves arranging data into a meaningful order to make it easier to understand, analyze, and visualize
- Filtering means showing only the data that meets a specific criteria while hiding the rest. A filter simplifies a spreadsheet by only showing us the information we need
