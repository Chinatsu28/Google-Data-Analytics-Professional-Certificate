# I. Manually cleaning data
- Verification is a process to confirm that a data cleaning effort was well-executed and the resulting data is accurate and reliable
- A changelog is a file containing a chronologically ordered list of modifications made to a project
- Data quality is the ability to identify and correct errors in data
- Process of verifying:
    + Compare the original dataset with the latter
    + Look for errors
    + Taking a big-picture view of your project
    + Notice if anything sticks out to you as suspicious or potentially problematic in your data
-  A pivot table is a data summarization tool that is used in data processing. Pivot tables sort, reorganize, group, count, total or average data stored in a database
- Find and replace is a tool that looks for a specified search term in a spreadsheet and allows you to replace it with something else
- CASE(SQL) statement goes through one or more conditions and returns a value as soon as a condition is met

# II. Documenting results and the cleaning process
- Documentation: the process of tracking changes, additions, deletions and errors involved in your data cleaning effort
- Having a record of how a data set evolved does three very important things
    + Recover data-cleaning errors
    + Inform other users of changes
    + Determine the quality of the data to be used in analysis
