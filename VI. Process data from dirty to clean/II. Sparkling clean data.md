# I. Data cleaning is a must
- Dirty data: data is incomplete, incorrect, or irrelevant to the problem you're trying to solve. It can't be used in a meaningful way, which makes analysis very difficult, if not impossible
- Clean data: data is complete, correct, and relevant to the problem you're trying to solve. This allows you to understand and analyze information and identify important patterns, connect related information, and draw useful conclusions
- Your co-workers: 
    + Data engineers transform data into a useful format for analysis and give it a reliable infrastructure
    + Data warehousing specialists develop processes and procedures to effectively store and organize data
