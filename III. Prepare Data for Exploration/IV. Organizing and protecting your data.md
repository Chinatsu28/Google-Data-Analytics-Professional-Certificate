# I. Effectively organize data

- Best practices when organizing data:
  + Naming convention
  + Foldering
  + Archiving older files
  + Align your naming and storage practices
  + Develop metadata practices

- Think about making a copy of the original data and store it somewhere else
- File naming DO's
  + Work out your convention early
  + Align file naming with your team
  + Make sure file names are meaningful
  + Keep file names short and sweet
  + Format dates yyyymmdd: SalesReport20201125
  + Lead revision number with 0: SalesReport20201125v02
  + Use hyphens, underscores, capitalized letters

# II. Securing data

- **Encryption** uses a unique algorithm to alter data and make it unusable by users and applications that don’t know the algorithm. This algorithm is saved as a “key” which can be used to reverse the encryption; so if you have the key, you can still use the data in its original form.  

- **Tokenization** replaces the data elements you want to protect with randomly generated data referred to as a “token.” The original data is stored in a separate location and mapped to the tokens.
