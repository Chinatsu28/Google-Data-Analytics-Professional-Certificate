# VI. Understanding open data
- In data analytics, open data is part of data ethics, which has to do with using data ethically. Openness refers to free access, usage, and sharing of data. But for data to be considered open, it has to: 
  +Be available and accessible to the public as a complete dataset 
  +Be provided under terms that allow it to be reused and redistributed 
  +Allow universal participation so that anyone can use, reuse, and redistribute the data 
  
Data can only be considered open when it meets all three of these standards.
