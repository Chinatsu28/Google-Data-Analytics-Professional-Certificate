# II. Data collection in our world
- Example: 
  + The US uses data to have a clear view of the population
- How data is collected:
    + Asking
    + Observation
    + Form
    + Questionaire
    + Survey
    + Cookie
- What collection consideration:
  + How the data will be collected
  + Choose data source
  + Decide what data to use
  + How much data is needed
  + What type of data to use
  + Determine the time frame

# III. Differentiate between data formats and structures
- Qualitative data vs quantitative data
- Discrete data: data that can be counted and have a limited amount. Discrete data isn't limited to dollar amounts. Examples of other discrete data are stars and points. When partial measurements (half-stars or quarter-points) aren't allowed, the data is discrete. If you don't accept anything other than full stars or points, the data is considered discrete.
- Continuous data: Data that is measured and can have almost any numeric value.
- Nominal data: a type of qualitative data that is categorized without a set order. 
- Ordinal data: a type of qualitative data that is categorized with a set order. 
- Internal data: Data that lives within a company's own system.
- External data: data that lives and generated outside a compny's own system.
- Structured data: data organized in a certain format such as rows and columns.
- Unstructured data: data that is not organized in any identifiable format.

- Understanding  unstructured data
  + Data model: a model that is used for organizing data elements and how they relate to one another.
  + Data elements: pieces of information.

# VI. Explore data types, fields and values
- Data type: A specific kind of data attribute that tells what kind of value the data is.
- Data types in spreadsheet:
  + String/Text
  + Number
  + Boolean
- Text data type, or a string data type, which is a sequence of characters and punctuation that contains textual information.
- A Boolean data type is a data type with only two possible values: true or false.
- With wide data, every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various attributes of the subject. 
- Long data is data in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject will have data in multiple rows. Our spreadsheet is formatted to show each year of population data.

- Data transformation usually involves: 
  + Adding, copying, or replicating data  
  + Deleting fields or records 
  + Standardizing the names of variables 
  + Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database
  + Joining one set of data with another
  + Saving a file in a different format

- Goals for data transformation might be:  
  + Data organization: better organized data is easier to use 
  + Data compatibility: different applications or systems can then use the same data 
  + Data migration: data with matching formats can be moved from one system to another 
  + Data merging: data with the same organization can be merged together 
  + Data enhancement: data can be displayed with more detailed fields 
  + Data comparison: apples-to-apples comparisons of the data can then be made
