# I. Understanding the power of data
- Data-inspired decision-making: explores different data sources to find out what they have in common
- Quantitative data: all about the specific and objective measures of numerical facts
- Qualitative data: describes subjective or explanatory measures of qualities and characteristics or things that can't be measured with numerical data, like your hair color

- Metric: single, quantifiable type of data that can be used for measurement
- Metric goal: a measurable goal set by a company and evaluated using metrics

# III. Connecting the data dots
- Small data:
  + Specific
  + Short period of time
  + Day-to-day decisions
 - Big data:
  + Large and less-specific
  + Long time period
  + Big decisions
