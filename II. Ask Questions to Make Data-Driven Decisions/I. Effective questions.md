# I. Problem solving and effective questioning
- Structured thinking: the process of recognizing the current problem or situation, organizing available information, revealing gaps and opportunities, and identifying the options


# II. Data in action
# III. Solve problems with data

- Commom problem types:
    + Making predictions: using data to make an informed about how things may be in the future
    + Categorizing things: assigning information to different groups or clusters based on common features
    + Spotting unusual: identifying data that is different from the norm
    + Identifying themes: grouping information into broader concepts
    + Discovering connections: enables data analysts to find similar challenges faced by different entities, and then combine data and insights to address them
    + Finding patterns; use data to find patterns by using historical data to understand what happened in the past and is therefore likely to happen again

# VI. Craft effective questions
- SMART methodology:
    + Specific questions are simple, significant and focused on a single topic or a few closely related ideas
    + Measurable questions can be quantified and assessed
    + Action-oriented questions encourage change
    + Relevant questions matter, are important and have significance to the problem you're trying to solve
    + Time-bound questions specify the time to be studied
    
- Here's an example that breaks down the thought process of turning a problem question into one or more SMART questions using the SMART method: What features do people look for when buying a new car?
    + Specific: Does the question focus on a particular car feature?
    + Measurable: Does the question include a feature rating system?
    + Action-oriented: Does the question influence creation of different or new feature packages?
    + Relevant: Does the question identify which features make or break a potential car purchase?
    + Time-bound: Does the question validate data on the most popular features from the last three years?
