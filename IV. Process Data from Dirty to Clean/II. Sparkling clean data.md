# I. Data cleaning is a must
- Dirty data: data is incomplete, incorrect, or irrelevant to the problem you're trying to solve. It can't be used in a meaningful way, which makes analysis very difficult, if not impossible
- Clean data: data is complete, correct, and relevant to the problem you're trying to solve. This allows you to understand and analyze information and identify important patterns, connect related information, and draw useful conclusions
- Your co-workers: 
    + Data engineers transform data into a useful format for analysis and give it a reliable infrastructure
    + Data warehousing specialists develop processes and procedures to effectively store and organize data

# II. Begin cleaning data
- Data that need to be removed/fixed:
    + Irrelevant data
    + Extra spaces and blank
    + Unwanted data
    + Misspelling
    + Wrong capitalization
   
- Merger: an agreement that unites two organizations into a single new one
- Data merging: action of combining two or more datasets into a single one
- Compatibility: how well two or more datasets work with each other
- What I need to ask:
    + Do I have all the data I need 
    + Does the data I need exist within these datasets
    + Does the data need to be cleaned, or are they ready for me to use
    + Are the datasets cleaned to the same standard

# III. Cleaning data in spreadsheet
- Conditional formatting: a spreadsheet tool that changes how cells appear when values meet specific conditions
- Remove duplicates: a tool that automatically searches for and eliminates duplicate entries from a spreadsheet
- Text string: a group of characters within a cell, most often composed of letters
- Split: a tool that divides a text string around the specified character and puts each fragment into a new and separate cell.
- Functions:
    + CONCATENATE: a function that joins multiple text strings into a single string
    + COUNTIF: is a function that returns the number of cells that match a specified value
    + LEFT: is a function that gives you a set number of characters from the left side of a text string
    + RIGHT: is a function that gives you a set number of characters from the right side of a text string
    + MID: is a function that gives you a segment from the middle of a text string
    + TRIM: is a function that removes leading, trailing, and repeated spaces in data
