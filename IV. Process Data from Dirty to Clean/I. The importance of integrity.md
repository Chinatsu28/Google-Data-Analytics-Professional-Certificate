# I. Focus on integrity
# II. Data integrity and analytics objectives
- A strong analytics depends on the integrity of the data
- Data integrity: the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its life cycle
- Reasons of losing integrity:
    + Data replicate: is the process of storing data in multiple locations
    + Data transfer: the process of copying data from a storage device to memory, or from one computer to another
    + Data manipulate: process involves changing the data to make it more organized and easier to read
    + Other: human, virus, malware

# VI. Testing your data
# V. Consider the margin of error
- Margin of error: the maximum that the sample results are expected to differ from those of the actual population
